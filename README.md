While the influencing factors for interest rate are various, a focus on global excess saving has driven the discussion to the global financial market.

In this study, a multiple linear regressio model is tested using 40-years data to examine the correlation between US interest rate and gross saving rate in EAP. The statistical result suggests that as EAP countries increase there saving rate, US interest rate tend to decrease in a significant degree.
